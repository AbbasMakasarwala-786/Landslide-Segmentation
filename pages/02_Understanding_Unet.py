st.text("U-Net is a widely used deep learning architecture that was first introduced in the “U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation” paper. The primary purpose of this architecture was to address the challenge of limited annotated data in the medical field. This network was designed to effectively leverage a smaller amount of data while maintaining speed and accuracy.")

st.markdown("### U-Net Architecture:")
st.text("The architecture of U-Net is unique in that it consists of a contracting path and an expansive path. The contracting path contains encoder layers that capture contextual information and reduce the spatial resolution of the input, while the expansive path contains decoder layers that decode the encoded data and use the information from the contracting path via skip connections to generate a segmentation map.The contracting path in U-Net is responsible for identifying the relevant features in the input image. The encoder layers perform convolutional operations that reduce the spatial resolution of the feature maps while increasing their depth, thereby capturing increasingly abstract representations of the input. This contracting path is similar to the feedforward layers in other convolutional neural networks. On the other hand, the expansive path works on decoding the encoded data and locating the features while maintaining the spatial resolution of the input. The decoder layers in the expansive path upsample the feature maps, while also performing convolutional operations. The skip connections from the contracting path help to preserve the spatial information lost in the contracting path, which helps the decoder layers to locate the features more accurately.")
